# Steps to install Qt5

### This step was already done when I tried it
sudo apt install qt5-default

### This step is only for Qt creator, probably not needed to run. Should check later if might be better to just install qt5  in laptop and work there, and delete the creator from here
sudo apt install qtcreator
